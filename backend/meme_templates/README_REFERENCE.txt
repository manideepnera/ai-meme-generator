Real-human reference for meme image generation
===============================================
To get "exactly real humans only" (no 3D, no art, no anime), the pipeline uses a reference image.

Option: Copy a photorealistic meme image (e.g. a film still or news photo of a real person) into this folder and name it:
  reference_real_human.png

That image will be sent to the Open API (Vision) as the TARGET STYLE so generated memes look like real photographs of real people.
